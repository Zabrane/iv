This is not an APL package yet.

The goal is to have a statistics package that works on streams
with accumulator types.

- receivers
	- avg, std, ... using compensating algorithms
	- histogram, t-Digest, ...
- generators
	- random numbers for different distributions
	- allowing monte-carlo type calculations
